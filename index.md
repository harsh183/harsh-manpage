I wrote my first technical post on my company's Engineering Blog that I'm now running: [Floats Don’t Work For Storing Cents: Why Modern Treasury Uses Integers Instead](https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/floats-dont-work-for-storing-cents)

I got to come back to UIUC to judge at HackIllinois 2025. I saw lots of cool projects and a shark-tank like final round presentation competition.

## RESEARCH

### PUBLICATIONS

**Validating Trust in Human-Robot Interaction Through Virtual Reality: Comparing Embodied and “Behind-the-Screen”
Interactions**, S Rodriguez, **H Deep**, D Asher, J Schaffer, A Kirlik [2023]
{: .sub-header}

Tried having participants vary based on doing a virtual warehouse task with 2D screens or VR to see if a robot assistant was trusted more. With 119 participants, the VR environments did lead to more trusting behavior.

**What’s This? A Voice and Touch Multimodal Approach for Ambiguity Resolution in Voice Assistants**, Jaewook Lee, Sebastian S Rodriguez, Raahul Natarrajan, Jacqueline Chen, **Harsh Deep**, Alex Kirlik [2021]
{: .sub-header}

We had a voice assistant where a participant could point their phone at a set of items and ask actions like "Find me a recipe that includes these" or "How to assemble this?" and that would include that as context for the AI. Users generally liked it based on the NASA-TLX scale and preferred it over not having the feature in the study

**Measuring complacency in humans interacting with autonomous agents in a multi-agent system**, SS Rodriguez, J Chen, **H Deep**, JJ Lee, DE Asher, E Zaroukian [2020]
{: .sub-header}

We created a group tag game where humans team up with AI to chase another AI. We varied how good the AI were to see if humans would get more complacent if the AI was really good. There was a lot of fun measurement with eye tracking to see focus, task load, and trust in automation.

## PROJECTS

<!-- throw in my abandonware from the ages -->

### OPEN SOURCE

**StompJS**
\--github_link=[stomp-js/stompjs](https://github.com/stomp-js/stompjs)
{: .sub-header}

StompJS is a library that lets browsers and other JS environments talk to AMQP Queues like RabbitMQ using STOMP. I added exponential backoff for connection issues, and wrote reference implementations in React and Svelte. (250k weekly downloads)
{: .section-content}

**ClassTranscribe**
\--github_link=[ClassTranscribe](https://github.com/classtranscribe)
{: .sub-header}

ClassTranscribe is an accessibility focused video website for educational lectures. I added support for live streams, modernized to recent Node [after a lot of pain](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-upgrade-node-and-jest-while-on-react-scripts-v4/) and added the first test cases to the project.

(Used by thousands of students across several universities)

\--github_link=[harsh183/uiuc-course-explorer-plus-plus/](https://github.com/harsh183/uiuc-course-explorer-plus-plus/)
{: .sub-header}

A browser extension that improves the UIUC Course Explorer website to allow directly jumping to a course page, google map links for all locations on campus, and links to GPA [statistics](https://1010labs.org/gpa) and Reddit gossip about the class.

**Fibonacci Array**
\--github_link=[harsh183/fibArray.rb](https://gist.github.com/harsh183/2c3a83ec356a16d4cf88bf0359b89c83)
{: .sub-header}

An experimental data structure that uses Fibonacci numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 to access list elements instead of typical index numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3.  
{: .section-content}

**Simple Kotlin Scoring Test Framework**
\--github_link=[harsh183/hackyTestWithScores.kt](https://gist.github.com/harsh183/fb32427bb283b5b546bab7974859060b)
{: .sub-header}

A simple hacky test framework that creates a DSL for writing test cases where there can be custom weights for scoring. The goal was to have a single file with no imports or frameworks required to run in a very fast kotlin environment.

**Fancy Git Client**
\--github_link=[harsh183/fgit](https://github.com/harsh183/fgit)
{: .sub-header}

A sleek command line git client that has interactive menus, colors, status sliders, nicer displays for a single command invocation to add, commit, and push.
