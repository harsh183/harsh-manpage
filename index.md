I wrote my first technical post on my company's Engineering Blog that I'm now running: [Floats Don’t Work For Storing Cents: Why Modern Treasury Uses Integers Instead](https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/floats-dont-work-for-storing-cents)

I got to come back to UIUC to judge at HackIllinois 2025. I saw lots of cool projects and a shark-tank like final round presentation competition.

## RESEARCH

### PUBLICATIONS

**Validating Trust in Human-Robot Interaction Through Virtual Reality: Comparing Embodied and “Behind-the-Screen”
Interactions**, S Rodriguez, **H Deep**, D Asher, J Schaffer, A Kirlik [2023]
{: .sub-header}

Tried having participants vary based on doing a virtual warehouse task with 2D screens or VR to see if a robot assistant was trusted more. With 119 participants, the VR environments did lead to more trusting behavior.

**What’s This? A Voice and Touch Multimodal Approach for Ambiguity Resolution in Voice Assistants**, Jaewook Lee, Sebastian S Rodriguez, Raahul Natarrajan, Jacqueline Chen, **Harsh Deep**, Alex Kirlik [2021]
{: .sub-header}

We had a voice assistant where a participant could point their phone at a set of items and ask actions like "Find me a recipe that includes these" or "How to assemble this?" and that would include that as context for the AI. Users generally liked it based on the NASA-TLX scale and preferred it over not having the feature in the study

**Measuring complacency in humans interacting with autonomous agents in a multi-agent system**, SS Rodriguez, J Chen, **H Deep**, JJ Lee, DE Asher, E Zaroukian [2020]
{: .sub-header}

We created a group tag game where humans team up with AI to chase another AI. We varied how good the AI were to see if humans would get more complacent if the AI was really good. There was a lot of fun measurement with eye tracking to see focus, task load, and trust in automation.

## PROJECTS

<!-- throw in my abandonware from the ages -->

**CTRL-Z-LIFE**
\--GitHub_link=[https://github.com/username/ctrl-z-life](https://github.com/username/ctrl-z-life)
{: .sub-header}

A revolutionary app that lets you undo real-life mistakes. Currently stuck in development because we can't undo the mistakes we made while building it. Features include: "What Did I Just Delete?" tracker and "Where Did I Put My Keys?" locator.
